The file "functions.sh" is a collection of useful functions that can help you with querying for ec2 instance properties and to help with easily switching between awscli named profiles. I source this file in my .bashrc file so that I can easily call them from the command line.

The script `stop_start_ec2.sh` can be used to easily stop and then start instances from the command line.

The script `resize_ec2.sh` can be used to quickly resize an ec2 instance to a new instance type.
